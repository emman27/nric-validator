# NRIC Validator  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emman27/nric-validator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emman27/nric-validator) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/emman27/nric-validator/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/emman27/nric-validator?branch=master)

A NRIC autocomplete / validator for Singapore NRIC / FIN numbers, in API form. This project is currently hosted at [nric.emmanuelgoh.me](http://nric.emmanuelgoh.me) via Heroku (free), and the endpoint at `/api/autocomplete`. If you enjoyed this project and/or would like to see this project scaled, feel free to clone the source code and use it yourself, or consider [supporting me](paypal.me/EmmanuelGoh).

### Inspiration
Saw [this video](https://www.facebook.com/thefunsocial/videos/309730776118437/?pnref=story) on Facebook, did a quick search and it seems that this only exists in a frontend based form. I've never built a JS app, so I thought I'd make this service available as an API.
